# Pizza restaurant

You can choose the pizza you want and track it in the cart

## Technologies that I used

In this project I used:

Typescript for data typing to avoid errors at the start of development

A state manager like redux allows you to remove unnecessary redrawing of components. It is also structured by slices, types, and selector folders.The —ÅreateAsyncThunk function allows you to receive data from a remote server and, using axios, receive data for further work with them.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
